dimpsy - pull data out of the twilight zone
==========================================

Dimpsy stands for Dataset Inventory Munging and	Polishing SYstem. It means also "twilight" (in southwest english dialect).
Unfortunately I am not familiar with southwest english dialect. However, a lot of datasets live in twilight zones such as Excel sheets
represented by data structures which are less suited for data analytics and often suffering from subtle errors introduced by auto-formatting.

Dimpsy aims to help pulling data from the twilight zone in a controlled way.
